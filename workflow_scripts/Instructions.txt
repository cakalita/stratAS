There are four scripts included in this:

1. wasp_pipeline.sh takes bam files through the WASP pipeline.

2. ase_read_counter.sh takes the bam file and counts the allele specific reads.

3. creating_ase_vcf.sh takes the read counts and merges them with a .vcf file for haplotype phasing. 

Between this step you should merge the outputted .vcfs for the main stratAS program.

4. stratas_params_script.sh provides a convient script to run the params.R script and should produce a single file which can be directly loaded into stratAS
